# server-side-api-practice

## Description

A practice project I created to practice on utilizing server-side APIs. The APIs in this project includes a traffic API called TomTom and a charging station map API called OpenCharge. These two APIs are also used in a project from my bootcamp called Project 1 in my repository.

## Process

The process included fetching both APIs and calling them on coordinate parameters. A geocoding URL turned city names into the coordinates used for both APIs.
